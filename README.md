Project is concerned with dealing of large datasets in Machine learning field. Generally regression or classification analysis of large datasets is a tedious task. Machine learning algorithms or Neural nets takes lot of time when dealing with the dataset that has lot of instances and features. Running a large dataset under an algorithm over a single processor or thread is a traditional technique.
Hence we have come up with the parallelising technique that can reduce runtime compilation of the problem. We use PySpark library in python for parallelising the dataset. Used Native spark for this project. It natively parallelises and distributes large dataset over the code.

o Applications used : Machine Learning, Parallelization.
o Libraries : Apache PySpark
